## Erikaar Backstory
---
### Before Birth
- His father, Ehr'endil, was an elf Paladin renowned for his legendary battle prowesses (Status unknown/MIA).
- His mother, Edea'Kalyn, was an elf Wizard who practiced Necromancy at the magic school of Haventithe.
- Blinded by the loss of her lover, Edea went alone to try and find him (while pregnant with Erikaar).
- She was eventually ambushed by a group of Goblins who held her prisoner.
- Starving and on the brink of death, Apholos manifested himself and offered to save her life and grant her great powers in exchange for her first born's servitude.
- Seeing this as the only way to save the life of both her own and her unborn child, she accepted and proceeded to decimate the Goblin camp with her newfound powers.
- She returned to Haventithe without her lover, and soon gave birth to Erikaar, who suddenly started to grow at an astounding rate inside his mother's womb.

### After Birth
- (Fey'ri) Because of the influence of Apholos on his mother's womb, Erikaar was born with an appearance akin to a Fey'ri, a race of Elves with a demonic ancestry.
- Because of his appearance, the school of Haventithe learned of his mother's dealings with an archdevil and banished her.
- (Wizard) The school kept Erikaar, in hopes to raise him as a Wizard and sway him from an evil path.
- Enraged by the school's decision, Edea decided to abandon her Wizard background and pledge herself as a Warlock of Apholos to harness her newfound powers.
- Erikaar grew up hearing amazing stories of his father, but the school always avoided the subject of his mother.
- (Bladesinger) Wanting to become a bit more like his father, he began developing a martial combat style that he used in conjunction with his Wizard teachings.
- (Haunted One Background) During his childhood and teenage years, he began feeling a dark and mysterious presence that manifested itself in horrible dreams, visions and voices that called out to him.
- He could feel that presence grow bigger every day, as if it was slowly walking towards him.
- He is able to communicate with this presence, but doing so seems to "feed" it and make it grow.
- As it grows, the more vivid and clear are its manifestations.
- Eventually, he learned of what his mother did through the presence who revealed itself as a manifestation of Apholos himself, who wants to claim his end of their deal.
- At the same time, he learned the reason behind his unique appearance and of his origins.
- As soon as he was old enough to leave the school, Erikaar decided to set out into the world in order to run from his dark fate while using this as an excuse to escape from the endless studying inside the school, from which he grew very tired.

### After Leaving Haventithe
- Over the years, Erikaar has been traveling from city to city, running away from the dark presence whenever it gets too close and taking any job that could finance his travels.
- Because of that, he gathered a lot of experience hunting monsters, demons and such.
- He hopes to grow strong enough one day so that he could finally face the presence himself instead of running away constantly.
