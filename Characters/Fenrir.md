Full name: Caspar van Darnus
Race: [[Human]]
Class: [[Rogue]]
Home: [[Brathia]]

## Background

Raised as the second son of house [[van Darnus]] in [[Brathia]], Caspar was a forthcoming talented child gifted with psychic abilities from birth. He lost his voice at the age of 11 during the attack against Brathia's royal palace. He became a bit more of a recluse afterwards and started hanging out with more misfortuned kids in the poorest districts of the city. He eventually met [[Lauryn]] and [[Hermione]] and joined the thieves guild called [[The Sons of Brathia]]. 

Just after turning 14, the [[Manoir van Darnus]] got attacked by a band of Drows. Attack during which both of Caspar's parents as well as his old mentor died. Caspar, fearing he was the one the assassins were after, decided to say his goodbyes to his brother [[Kevin van Darnus]] and left [[Brathia]] for the [[White Plains]] in the hopes of finding out more about his psychic abilities and meet what his old mentor called his "[[soulbind]]". 

Caspar spent almost two years in a little shamanic village dividing his time between writing, training, and spending time with [[Tiet]], a good friend he had made there. After hearing of a wild god called Fenrir, Caspar departed on a journey in the wild looking for the great wolf spirit. He eventually found it and, after a series of test, Fenrir decided that Caspar was worthy of wielding his power and fused its own spirit with him.

Before fusing with Fenrir, Caspar had to promise the great wolf that he would:
 1) Never marry
 2) Never wield magic, magic items, or magic weapons unless they are in direct alignment with nature and/or its preservation
 3) Always fight against any who would desecrate nature and/or animals

Caspar, now called Fenrir, left the [[White Plains]] with [[Tiet]] to go back south in search of adventures in order to gain strength and learn to develop and control the powers provided to him by the great wolf.
