Location: [[Brathia]]
The game starts with the living armor following us and [[Maeve]] and [[Hakaar]] are sleeping and can't be woke up.

[[Fenrir|Caspar]] drops the mirror on the floor and goes back down. 
[[Whiskers]] is trying to move [[Maeve]] outside and has her on his back and goes up the stairs. 
[[Maeve]] sleeps.
[[Hakaar]] sleeps.
[[Tiet]] goes beside [[Hakaar]] to try and move him.
[[Erikaar]] enters the house and seems quite lost seeing [[Maeve]] sleeping, he shots a bolt at the armor.
The armor walks slowly toward us, extends with the smoke and slashes [[Aleesia]] by a lot.
[[Aleesia]] teleports [[Hakaar]] up the stairs and run upstairs yelling there's a crazy armor attacking people, to grab the body and run.
[[Fenrir]] grabs a painting and runs away.
[[Whiskers]] heals [[Aleesia]] and runs downstairs to warn the other again, he inspires [[Tiet]] and goes back up.
[[Tiet]] slings fire on the armor, it almost does nothing then run upstairs.
[[Erikaar]] runs upstair slashing the armor on the way but completely misses.
Everyone runs away, the combat finishes.

We run to the main road, 2 gards yell at us to stop. As we go to talk with them the armor bursts behind us and floats. The gards go to stop it and are attacked. [[Whiskers]] decide to run with [[Maeve]], the other stays to attack the armor.

Combat phase 2:

Round 1
[[Tiet]] attacks with a lance and punchrd the armor, does not do as much as he thought. 
[[Erikaar]] does his shadow blades and attacks him with psychic damage but seems resistant.
The armor attacks [[Erikaar]] but completely misses with his sword but tentacles extands from his arm and restrains the armor. He then goes inside the house dragging [[Erikaar]] along.
[[Whiskers]] drops [[Maeve]] on the ground then does cloud of dagger on the armor.
[[Fenrir]] sends psychic daggers but misses et cours derriere la maison.
[[Hoodini]] flies in and attacks the armor. 
One gard attacks the tentacle, the other pulls on [[Erikaar]] freeing him.
[[Aleesia]] does Toll the dead but he's immune.

Round 2
[[Tiet]] attacks again with his lance but misses but then punches him.
[[Erikaar]] removes the piecies of tentacles and throws the shadow blade at the armor.
The armor attacks a gard and hurts him, his tentacle grabs the other tentacle.

The gards yell for help.
[[Aleesia]] tries a cantrip but nothing happens.

Round 3
[[Tiet]] attacks well with the spear then misses the punches.
[[Erikaar]] throws his shadow blade but misses.
The armor constricts the gard and we hear bones breaking and he seems to die. Staying in the cloud of daggers he seems to take a good amount of damage. He then attacks Tiet and it seems to hurt.
[[Whiskers]] attacks with his crossbow and crits! but doesn't do much damage.
[[Fenrir]] attacks with the daggers and does a nice 19 dmg attack with his sneak attack dagger.
[[Hoodini]] fly-by.
The gards misses everything, they are not the heros of this game.
[[Aleesia]] mind sliver's but nothing happens.

Round 3
[[Tiet]] attacks again and remove the arm of the armor. He then finds a weak point in the armor with his punches and repeatedly attacks it killing it. 

Victory!
Short quick combat, a gard almost dies but is saved by [[Whiskers]], [[Tiet]] has the final blow!


[[Whiskers]] talks to the guard, saying we were there to see friends, we think the armor killed them inside. We don't understand where it came from. The gard suggest we go see [[Lorvroth]] at the [[Vanguard bastion]].

[[Fenrir]] goes back inside see if we missed anything. He takes the stone and the feather. 

The rest goes to [[Maeve]] and [[Hakaar]]. The gard arrives and tells us we are suspect and where to find us. [[Whiskers]] is ashamed and the gard apologies and says not suspect, more as witness. 

We take back the road toward the [[Manoir van Darnus]]. 
[[Fenrir]] looks at the  small mirror, his reflection his cloudy, as if smoke was inside.

Getting at the manor, the door is slighly opened and we hear yelling from the inside. We see [[Kayvun van Darnus]] yelling at the cleaning workers. 

[[Kayvun van Darnus]] admits the [[Van Dalmus]] are now poor, the mine is now closed. [[Fenrir]] is surprised by this but want to keep the house of their parents cleaned. [[Fenrir]] wants to keep the house cleaned but says being [[Paladin]] doesn't pay. [[Irakin]] to take care of the manoir. Kevin goes upstairs. [[Aleesia]] tries to reassure [[Fenrir]] but he doesn't look too sure. 

[[Fenrir]] goes to see [[Kayvun van Darnus]], he seems sad. [[Fenrir]] asks if he can help [[Maeve]] and [[Hakaar]] since they are asleep. He doesn't think he can help. He tries a spell but it doesn't help. Says [[Haventithe]] could help or the higher ranks at the [[Groups/Trinity Temple]].

Justicar: Helmet with 2 wings. God of justice.

The groups go to the [[Haventithe]] academy to see [[Alufine]]. We get a few looks on the way. She's currently reading. [[Erikaar]] tells her he's back with [[Maeve]] and if she could help with the 2 which are asleep. Elle passe sa main devant ses yeux qui deviennent vert et il y a effectivement un sort. Elle Dispel Magic et ils se réveillent. Ils sont confus mais correct. 

Elle veut un repaiement. [[Whiskers]] fait Suggestion voir si elle pourrait seulement être gentille et le prendre comme une bonne action pour la journée. Il manque mais elle ne le sait pas. 

[[Fenrir]] lui montre le [[Bound mirrors]] et elle fait Identify dessus. On parle pendant qu'on attend.
Elle redonne le mirroir, il est enchanté avec un autre mirror avec un Scrying, donné a [[Aleesia]]. 

On négocie que parler a [[Maeve]] va couvrir notre paiement. Elle accepte. [[Maeve]] dit que ça vient de son père. 

Discussion, see [[Maeve]] section. 

On repars vers l'extérieur.

Black book with red stains on it.

Tu recois un message genre télépathique de la part de la mère, Naedithas. "Hi Aleesia. Your father is preparing his journey to [[the Herald]] and he would like that you are present before he leaves. Please take care."



On se repose, il aurait dormi pendant 3 mois. 
[[Erikaar]] et [[Aleesia]] va magasiner. Il cherche une gilded flower comme ingrédient magique.

On va chez [[Arto's]] pour des ingrédients magique. En sortant on est rendu a un autre endroit pas très loin. 

[[Fenrir]] fait un bain pour [[Maeve]]. Elle kick [[Fenrir]] dehors avant d'aller dans le bain. 

[[Fenrir]] parle de comment [[Ikriveel Battleore|Veel]] avait des reves avec les [[Blae'bir]]. Ils se sont rencontrer dans le cimitiere dans les plains avec la drow. C'est les drows qui ont tuer le mari de [[Ikriveel Battleore|Veel]]. 

[[Hakaar]] fait un recap a [[Erikaar]] et [[Aleesia]] quand on arrive. La drow s'appelle [[Zesle]]
