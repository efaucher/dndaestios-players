Still at the manor, trying to decide what to do.

[[Bound mirrors#Session 9]]


Three groups: [[Aleesia]] and [[Erikaar]] going to [[Haventithe]] to try and decipher the map. [[Fenrir]], [[Tiet]], and [[Hakaar]] going towards the [[Groups/Trinity Temple]] to tell [[Kevin van Darnus]] what they just found out. [[Whiskers]] going to the tavern to sing.

**Aleesia and Erikaar**

[[Haventithe]] , in the library. They get direction to astronomy section. They see an half-orc placing books. He is a smart brute, wearing glasses. His name is [[Maruk]].

 They give him the map. He thinkgs th map is weird, the constellation are not positioned right. He uses the map and the text that was next to it to try and figure out what it all means.
 
After talking by writing on a chlkboard for 10 minutes, they finally decide to go outside the library to talk.

[[Maruk]] eventually decide to join the group to learn more about this.

**Whisker**
He sings beautifully and makes 15GP. After his performance he stays a little and one other performance catches his attention. 

See [[Song of the Forest Knight]]

The bard is a blue Tiefling and the song seems to be about [[Maeve]]. His name is [[Thefix]] and [[Whiskers]] talks with him for a while. The song comes a dream he had. 

[[Whiskers]] has sex.

**Caspar, Hakaar, Tier**

[[Kevin van Darnus]] is talking with another templar, Genasi. I tell him what's happened but he is very preoccupied and asks that we leave with him. He tells us that something fishy going on with the Templars. Some of the Templars from Eboncross came back and then disappeared. 

We go back to the mansion. [[Kevin van Darnus]] goes to his room and comes back with a journal. It is from Caspar's father relating events about assassination attempts against noble families. 

Father mines, fungus infestation. Demands from funding from king, denied. Mines were closed, it's pretty obvious that the Drows wanted people out of the mines.

Caspar goes to Starry Night to find someone who can keep eyes on the mines for a night to see. Beaudry is there :) Caspar goes to speak to Lauryn, tells him everything that has happened and says he needs him to spy on the mines for the night to see if anyone comes in or out.

[[Fenrir|Caspar]] sees guards running to the [[Tsarra's Respite]].

**Whiskers**

He gets ready to have sex and gets stabbed in the back by a [[Drow]]. [[Whiskers]] is paralyzed on the bed. 

[[Fenrir|Caspar]] climbs wall and gets inside the inn. He sees a blue Tiefling [[Thefix]] with a dagger in the back seemingly dead on the floor. He crosses the corridor and goes towards the room where [[Whiskers]] is. [[Fenrir|Caspar]] picks up [[Whiskers]] and drags him to the previous room.

[[Fenrir|Caspar]] picksup [[drow]] dagger from Tiefling back and starts trying to get Whiskers through the window onto the steet asking the other ones that are getting here now to help him.

[[Erikaar]] helps [[Fenrir|Caspar]], he gets stuck with him hanging from the roof.

Orc jumps and lesser restoration to remove the paralyzed.

Guard come and see Caspar in front of body with dagger in hand, Caspar tries to lie, doesnt work, jumps through window.

CHASE SCENE

People run. Tiet make flames towards the following vangards. Fenrir splits from the group in hopes of drawing some of them away. Aleesia creates an illusionary wall. Orc morphs into Panther to run faster.

People keep dashing. Caspar drew one away, hides and loses him. Dash. Dash. Dash. For. The. Others.

Aleesia casts Vortex Warp on her and Tiet to teleport them further away. Hakaar feline jumps of a wall to make guards tumble behind him. Orc-panther jumps on walls and on the roofs and runs on the roofs.

Tiet opens sewer grate and jumps in. The others are slowly breaking out of the chase and getting to safety. Whiskers is the last one being chased. He breaks into an allyway and gets in front of the little tankard and see a brawl going on. Whiskers gets into the fight and start punching a guy. Guards keep running. 

Chase over.

We communicate telepathically to make sure we're okay. Everyone eventually starts going towards the manor.

Maruk Bloodaxe to the others. 

On discute et make sure que tout le monde est on board pour rester et aller chercher les drows le lendemain. On dors tous dans le hall d'entr√©e.
