# Story
## Session 9
[[Erikaar]] studies the mirror. The mirror goes black and we start hearing voices. The other side of the mirror is pitch black room. He sees [[Zesle]] discussing with someone else (a female Asimar) through another mirror. She has a scar on the side of her face. 

The Asimar talks to Zesle as if she was her boss. Zesle hates her.

Another Drow (male, mage) enters, scar over left eye, red eyes. The Drow is the one who attacked the Brathian palace and made Fenrir lose his voice. He notices us through the mirror and shatters it. His name is [[Senlin]].

Aleesia casts a spell to find the other mirror. It is underneath the earth below the mountain.
