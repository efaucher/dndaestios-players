# **Song of the Forest's Knight**

Let me tell a story of a full plated knight  
wearing only green, shining in daylight  
He comes from the lush forest of the East,  
he smelled of oaks, pines and beasts.  
  
He came into town, stranger to all  
he met the mayor at the city hall  
"Gentlemen, I'm here, don't be afraid"  
"I've come here to bring aid"  
  
"Take a seat; Let me hear your pains"  
"Nobody could ever stopped me, not even chains"  
" Let me help you; all I want is to make you smile"  
"then I'll go back, with memories, to my Emerald Isle"  
  
The mayor, hope in his sparkling eyes  
Accepted right away, regardless of the price  
"Knight of the Forest; I'm glad you are here"  
"Once you've slain the beast lurking by, you'll have your beer"  
  
The Knight reached for his blade and took the road  
towards North, for the lair of the foul beast  
He walked around town, gathering a crowd,  
everybody followed, even the priest!  
  
As he walked, a glimmer took the air  
up until this day, I don't know from where  
People claimed for the Knight in green  
even harder than for the Burned Queen!  
  
But reality shifted around the plated man  
and then from there, troubles began  
The Knight laughed as hard he could  
still people were wondering about his knighthood  
  
"Ladies and Gentlemen, don't panic"  
"It's really not something evil or Satanic"  
"I'm here to make your life anew;"  
"all your wishes will become true!"  
  
From the sky above, a green transparent beam  
shined upon the knight, making it gleam  
Suddenly, the crowd starting to scream;  
I can assure you, it wasn't a dream!  
  
From the sky, gold started to fall down  
toys, books and all sorts of things  
started to fill up this little town  
all this worth, almost just for kings!  
  
"Forget about the foul beast of the North"  
"You got everything that is worth"  
"Let it be, let it live, let it free"  
"Let the Forest live in its decree"  
  
We never knew from where he came  
But I'm glad to sing this song tonight  
Remember this tale; remember his name  
as he is: the Forest's Knight
